# PotatoTech - Android App for Potato Leaf Disease Classification

🌱**Introduction**  
PotatoTech is an Android application designed to classify potato leaf diseases. It aims to accurately identify whether a potato leaf is healthy or diseased, specifically detecting Early Blight and Late Blight using machine learning models.

📌**Objectives**  
- Develop a prediction system to identify the health status of potato leaves.
- Integrate an efficient machine learning model for specific disease detection (Early Blight and Late Blight).
- Design a user-friendly interface for image submission and health status prediction.

🥔**Data Collection**  
The dataset used is "Plant Village - Potato Disease Classification," available on Kaggle. It includes three categories:
- Healthy Potato
- Potato Early Blight
- Potato Late Blight

⭐️**Key Features**  
- Accurate classification of potato leaf diseases.
- User-friendly interface for image submission.
- Real-time health status prediction.
